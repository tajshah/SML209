<h1>Women in History</h1>
<p> When one thinks of memorable German people it is more than likely that the majority if not all are men. This lead to my inspiration for this page. I have listed 6 women you perhaps did not know of but who made an important impact to the germans history that we know of now. </p>

<p> Sophia Magdalena Scholl (9 May 1921 â€“ 22 February 1943) was a German student and anti-Nazi political activist, active within the White Rose non-violent resistance group in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>She was convicted of high treason after having been found distributing anti-war leaflets at the University of Munich (LMU) with her brother, Hans. As a result, she was executed by guillotine. Since the 1970s, Scholl has been extensively commemorated for her anti-Nazi resistance work.</p>
