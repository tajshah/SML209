<h1>Fashion during the third reich</h1>
<p> What is fashion? It's classified as "popular or the latest style of clothing, hair, decoration, or behavior. Focus on clothing and hair" During the third reich the nazi regime wanted to control everything, which also included how the women of Germany should dress.</p>

<h2> Deutsches Modeamt</h2>
<p>One of the more surprising aspects of Hitler’s arrival in power in 1933 was the foundation of a German Fashion Institute. Known as the Deutsches Modeamt, it was a reflection of Nazi attempts to control every aspect of women’s lives, including what they wore.</p>
<p>Hitler was an unlikely fashionista – despite overseeing the uniform for the Bund Deutsche Mädel, his approach to feminine adornment was generally negative. He hated make-up – often remarking that lipstick was composed of animal waste – and disapproved of hair dye. Perfume disgusted him, though he bowed to Eva Braun’s enthusiasm for it, and smoking was revolting. Trousers were out, too, as unfeminine, and fur was horrific because it involved killing animals. Yet he displayed a typical ambivalence about fashion, proclaiming that ‘Berlin women must become the best dressed in Europe’, and claiming ‘what I like best of all is to dine with a pretty woman.’<p/>
<p>In essence the Deutsches Modeamt, established with full governmental support, existed to put the fascist into fashion. Women would wear only clothes made by German designers, with German materials. German, of course, meant Aryan, which knocked out the vast majority of the existing textile trade and high society designers. An organisation called the Association of Aryan Clothing Manufacturers quickly sprung up, with its own label to be sewn into garments, guaranteeing that they had only been touched by Aryan hands. The image promoted by the Institute celebrated tradition, making dirndls, bodices and Tyrolean jackets all the rage. Wearing Tracht, a regional folk costume, came to symbolise Völkish spirit. But more important even than this, was Hitler’s desire to extinguish French influence in the German fashion industry. He hated Paris fashion, firstly because it was French but also because the styles pioneered by designers like Chanel encouraged an unnaturally slender silhouette. A nation of women striving for slim hips and boyish bodies was certainly not ideal if you wanted to encourage prolific child-bearing. ‘No more Paris models,’ he announced in June 1933.</p>
<p>One of the richest ironies of the Reich Fashion Institute, and the one which made it such an irresistible subject for a novelist, was the choice of Magda Goebbels, wife of the Propaganda Minister, as honorary president. Like many other aspects of Third Reich, her participation was rife with contradictions. The chain smoking, Elizabeth Arden-coated Magda adored couture. Her favourite designers, Paul Kuhnen, Richard Goetz and Fritz Grünfeld, were Jewish. She wore hand-made Ferragamo shoes. The other senior Nazi wives, especially Annelies von Ribbentrop and Inge Ley, wife of the Labour leader Robert Ley, had similar tastes. Magda attempted to modify the ‘Gretchen’ image of the Fashion Institute by musing publicly that ‘the German woman of the future should be stylish, beautiful and intelligent’. It may have been this attempt to change the face of Nazi chic which led her husband to sack her from the Deutsches Modeamt later in 1933, but the Institute itself lived on until 1944, an unlikely instance of the perverted politics of fashion.</p>

<h2>Wartime Fashions and Rationing</h2>
<p>On 14 November 1939, two months after the onset of World War II, the government issued the first Reichskleiderkarte (or Reich Clothing Card). This rationing system was designed to ensure an equitable means by which to supply the civilian population with sufficient shoes, clothing, and textiles during the war. German Jews, deemed unworthy of receiving even minimal support, received no clothing coupons beginning in 1940. The clothing card was based on a point system, from which a recipient could not use more than 25 points in the time span of two months. Numerous other restrictions also applied. Hats were "points-free," which meant they could be acquired without ration vouchers or clothing cards and so would become the major fashion item of the war years. Once hat supplies were depleted, and thus unobtainable for purchase, women created their own turbans and hats from fabric remnants, lace scraps, netting, and felt pieces.</p>

<p>The first clothing card, good for one year, allotted 100 points, but severe shortages rapidly developed in several areas, particularly shoes and cloth. Because textile and leather production increasingly was geared toward the needs of the German army, many stores were soon emptied of their reserves. Consequently, material remnants replaced leather shoe uppers, and soles were often made from cork or wood. Additionally, the government quickly discovered that its autarkic economic policy had, in part, resulted in an unsuccessful scramble for a wide variety of viable synthetics that were urgently needed to keep Germans, military and civilian, clothed. Many of the textile and leather substitutes were of poor quality and disintegrated when washed or ironed.</p>
<p> The second clothing card, issued in the late fall of 1940, was worth 150 points, but the additional 50 points had no real value since, by then, extreme clothing and footwear shortages had developed in several major German cities. Widely circulated government brochures urged women to "make new from old," but a dearth of available sewing goods, such as thread and yarn, contradicted the state's catchy mottos. Despite admonishments by those who viewed pants as unfeminine and unacceptable female attire, women increasingly wore trousers as the war dragged on and shortages continued to mount. Pants were warmer than skirts, especially once supplies of stockings and socks had been exhausted. They were far more practical for women to wear as work attire in war-related factories. And, often, they were the only clothes item in the household still in plentiful supply, with so many absent husbands and brothers serving in the armed forces.</p>
<p>By 1943, drastic garment and shoe shortages rendered the clothing card virtually useless in some areas of Germany. In response, civilians turned ever more frequently to the burgeoning black market, even though this was a highly punishable offence. The inability of the regime to provide adequate clothing provisions throughout the war years was met with growing resentment and overtly expressed discontent, which belied the Nazis' depiction of a harmonious, supportive national community.</p>
